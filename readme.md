Sibyl - A watchman event viewer
===============================

Why sibyl: They were oracles which gleamed information
from Chthonic dieties---ie they got their information
from within the earth (underground).

Sibyl is a simple pythonic event viewer that will interact
with rat-pac to provide a 2d and 3d event display. The display
itself is meant to look modern and be cross-platform, with the
only strong dependency being on rat-pac.

Dependencies
------------
Python3
Qt (need to consider both 4 and 5)
Plotly (this has proved much faster than other sources for 3d)
PyQtGraph
python-opengl
